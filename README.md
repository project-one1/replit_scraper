# Replit Web Scraper - Short

Hello! This is a personal coding challenge to see if I can make a functioning job scraper (with a readable codebase) in just 30 lines.

This uses replit.com, a free online IDE. You could definitely do this in VS Code, but I found it easier to use the help of ```import requests``` and ```from bs4 import BeautifulSoup``` (available on [Replit.com](https://replit.com)) to get the scraping done.

Feel free to modify the code as you see fit!
